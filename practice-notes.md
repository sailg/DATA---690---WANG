- The Python interpreter runs a program by execut‐
ing one statement at a time. 

- Part of Python’s success in scientific computing is the ease of integrating C, C++, and
FORTRAN code.

- While Python is an excellent environment for building many kinds of analytical
applications and general-purpose systems.

- Python can be a challenging language for building highly concurrent, multithreaded
applications, particularly applications with many CPU-bound threads. The reason for
this is that it has what is known as the global interpreter lock (GIL), a mechanism that
prevents the interpreter from executing more than one Python instruction at a time.

-  Numerical Python(NUMPY) has long been a cornerstone of numerical com‐
puting in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed
for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python.

- Pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working
with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive.

- Matplotlib  is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other twodimensional data visualizations. 

-  SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem
domains in scientific computing.
